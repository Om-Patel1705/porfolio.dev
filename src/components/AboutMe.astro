      Hi, I'm Om Patel, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information and
      Communication Technology at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and
      Communication Technology (DA-IICT). My academic journey has equipped me
      with a strong foundation in problem-solving and various programming
      languages, including <strong>C, C++, JavaScript, and SQL</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My passion lies in <strong
        >Web Development, DSA, and Problem Solving</strong
      >. I have practical experience building full-stack applications, evident
      in my projects. For instance, I designed and developed a <strong
        >real-time Chat-App using React and Chakra UI for the frontend,
        Socket.IO for real-time communication, and PostgreSQL for the database,
        implementing both client and server sides with custom REST APIs</strong
      >. I also built an <strong
        >IRCTC-inspired full-stack web app for train booking with custom
        authentication using React, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL for
        seamless ticket booking and reservations</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond web development, I have gained valuable insights into the IT
      industry through my work on a <strong
        >Product Inner Label Generating Project at NHB Ball Roller Ltd, Bilimora</strong
      >. I also contributed to community outreach programs and tree plantation
      initiatives by leveraging the HaritGhar application during my experience
      with <strong>MMMNGO in Valsad</strong>. I am proficient with tools and
      technologies such as <strong
        >VSCode, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an <strong>IFest Coordinator</strong>, I've honed my organizational
      skills by coordinating Iclash. My commitment to learning and growth is
      highlighted by my achievement as a <strong
        >WOC Mid-Evaluation Winner</strong
      > and the completion of a comprehensive <strong
        >Web Development Course by Angela Yu</strong
      >. I am always eager to apply my skills and learn new technologies to
      build impactful solutions.
