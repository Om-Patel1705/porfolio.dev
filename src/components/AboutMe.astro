      Hi, I'm <strong>Om Patel</strong>, a B.Tech student in ICT at DA-IICT. I'm passionate about <strong>Full Stack Web Development</strong>, <strong>DSA</strong>, and <strong>Problem Solving</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've built projects like a <strong>real-time Chat App</strong> (React, Chakra UI, Socket.IO, PostgreSQL) and an <strong>IRCTC-inspired booking system</strong> using custom REST APIs.
    </p>

    <p>
      I interned at <strong>NHB Ball Roller Ltd</strong>, creating a product label automation system, and worked on <strong>HaritGhar</strong> during my time with MMMNGO. I’m also familiar with tools like <strong>Git, VSCode, Postman, and PgAdmin</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an <strong>IFest Coordinator</strong>, I led the <strong>iClash</strong> gaming event. I was a <strong>WOC Mid-Evaluation Winner</strong> and completed Angela Yu’s full-stack development course.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy building solutions, exploring <strong>AI/ML</strong>, and learning modern technologies like <strong>LangChain</strong> and <strong>LLMs</strong>.
